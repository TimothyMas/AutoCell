# AutoCell

AutoCell is an interactive implementation of Conway's Game of Life, a cellular automaton that simulates the evolution of a grid of cells. This Qt-based application allows you to explore the fascinating world of cellular automata, create custom patterns, and watch as they evolve over generations.

## Key Features

- Interactive grid for toggling cell states
- Real-time simulation with adjustable speed
- Random grid initialization
- Color-coded cells based on age and state
- User-friendly GUI for customization
- Educational tool for exploring emergent behavior

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with AutoCell:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Build the application using Qt Creator.
3. Run AutoCell to start experimenting with Conway's Game of Life and discover the patterns and behaviors that emerge from simple rules.

## Usage

- Left-click on the grid to toggle cell states.
- Use the "Start" button to begin the simulation.
- Adjust the simulation speed with the button.
- Click the "Stop" button to pause the simulation.
- Press "Reset" to clear the grid and start over.
